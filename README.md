# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Problem: Develop a model to predict heart disease based on patient attributes.
Data: Gathered medical records including age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and heart disease presence.
Model: Implemented logistic regression for binary classification.
Training: Split data, trained model, evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Interpretation: Analyzed coefficients, visualized results (confusion matrix, ROC curve).
Deployment: Deployed model for real-time predictions.
Future: Considered enhancements like feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
Conclusion: Developed effective heart disease prediction model with logistic regression.
